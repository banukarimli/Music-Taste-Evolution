Here is my project on my music taste evolution based on one of my playlists. The main aim of this project was to analyze the change in the genres and artists, as well as my overall music preferences over the period of January to September, and showcase the shift in the genres throughout the playlist. This repository includes the ReadMe file, my python code, and a detailed report. 

In the code, main data sources CSV file and .json file including my streaming history were processed to obtain the DataFrame. The processed data is later analyzed using various techniques such as Exploratory Data Analysis and visualization tools to showcase the change in the genres over time, top artists and genres, numerical data of the songs and their correlations to better understand the shift in my overall music preferences. 

In the report, a more detailed information is provided on the motivation behind the project, data that was used and analyzed, various tools used to analyze the playlist and the numerical information.
